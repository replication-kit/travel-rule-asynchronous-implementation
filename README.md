This repository contains the Python simulation code used in the paper  
**“Asynchronous Implementation of the Travel Rule and Transitional Risks in Crypto-Asset Regulation”**,  
submitted to the *Journal of Financial Regulation*.

The code implements a parsimonious agent-based model (ABM) that analyzes how
asynchronous international adoption and heterogeneous implementation capacity
of the Travel Rule affect transaction behavior and illicit activity during the
regulatory transition period.

## Repository structure

- `src/`
  - `Figure2.ipynb`  
    Generates **Figure 2** (main simulation results: illicit activity, detection rate,
    and transaction channel composition under scenarios S, A, and A′).
  - `Figure3.ipynb`  
    Generates **Figure 3** (robustness analysis with respect to adoption delays
    and implementation speed).
  - `Figure_B1_lambda.ipynb`  
    Sensitivity analysis with respect to behavioral sensitivity (λ).
  - `Figure_B2_F.ipynb`  
    Sensitivity analysis with respect to sanction severity (F).
  - `Figure_B3_kC.ipynb`  
    Sensitivity analysis with respect to P2P transaction frictions.
  - `Figure_B4_N.ipynb`  
    Sensitivity analysis with respect to the number of agents (N).

- `requirements.txt`

Each notebook is self-contained and can be run independently.  
This design choice avoids long execution times and allows readers to reproduce
individual figures without running the full set of simulations.

## Requirements

The simulations were developed and tested using Python 3.9+.

Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.

To install dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the simulations

1. Install the required packages as described above.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Open any of the `.ipynb` files (e.g. `Figure2.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook
   or JupyterLab.
4. Run all cells to reproduce the corresponding figure.

By default, each notebook uses a moderate number of Monte Carlo repetitions
to ensure reasonable execution time.  
Comments in the code indicate where the number of repetitions can be increased
to reproduce the exact figures used in the final manuscript.

## Reproducibility and scope

The code in this repository is intended to reproduce the qualitative and
comparative results reported in the paper.  
Parameter values are chosen for transparency and interpretability rather than
for calibration to any specific jurisdiction.

The notebooks are deliberately separated by figure to improve readability
and to make replication easier for reviewers and readers.

## Data availability

No external datasets are used in this study.

All data analyzed in the paper are generated by the simulation code contained
in this repository.
